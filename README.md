Data Structures
An introduction to techniques and building blocks for organizing large programs. 
Topics include: modules, abstract data types, recursion, algorithmic efficiency, 
and the use and implementation of standard data structures and algorithms, such 
as lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, priority queues, tables, sorting, and 
searching. 
Students become familiar with these concepts through weekly programming assignments 
using the Java programming language.
